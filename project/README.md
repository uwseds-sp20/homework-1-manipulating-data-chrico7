This folder contains my work on the Homework 1 assignment for the Spring Quarter DATA515 course.

The purpose of this project is to introduce the basics of data manipulation using Python (pandas and maplotlib) 

This project performs the following analysis:

Given the CSV file containing the counts of bicycles crossing the Fremont Bridge since 2012 
Fremont_Bridge_Bicycle_Counter.csv

1. Read the CSV file into a pandas dataframe. (1 pt)
2. Add columns to the dataframe containing: ( 3 pt)
   i.   The total (East + West) bicycle count
   ii.  The hour of the day
   iii. The year
3. Create a dataframe with the subset of data from the year 2016 (1 pt)
4. Use pandas + matplotlib to plot the counts by hour. (1 pt)
   (i.e. hour of the day on the x-axis, total daily counts on the y-axis)
5. Use pandas to determine what is (on average) the busiest hour of the day (1 pt)
